NOTE: I'm currently going through the code base to refactor it, modifying this along the way. Guidelines defined here are temporary and subject to changes

The style guide is based on https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/[vuejs'], and rules defined there  are to be followed except when superseded by rules defined here.

## Components
### File names
All components filenames should reflect the component's name, and be in PascalCase.

Ordering of words in the name should be in generic-to-specific order: `ButtonNormal` instead of `NormalButton`. This greatly improves file sorting.

Additionally, prefix component names with the following:

[%header,cols=2*]
|===
| Prefix
| Situation

| Base
| Components that are only used in other components

| The
| Components that are only used once in pages

| Input
| UI Component that are made for user data input
|===

### No outer margins on components

Components should not include any king of spacing on the component's root element: components and pages that includes a component should be responsible for its spacing relative to the other elements included.

### Inheritance

[%header, cols=2*]
|===
| Components that... 
a| Should inherit from...

| are cards | `BaseCard`
| are user input fields | `BaseInput`
| are modals interacting with resources (add/edit/delete) | `BaseModalObject`
| are modals | `BaseModal`
|===

### Tests

All components should be tested using a single test file at `tests/components/ComponentName.test.js`

Use the following boilerplate for the tests:
```javascript
import { bootstrapComponentTest } from '../utils'
import ComponentName from '~/components/ComponentName.vue'

const { mnt, store } = bootstrapComponentTest(
  ComponentName
  // Put the default store here
  // Put the default propsData here
)

describe('<ComponentName>', () => {
  it('does what it is supposed to do', () => {
    const ComponentName = mnt(/* Provide propsData if needed */)
    // Do your actions (emit a click, etc)
    expect(/* predicate */)./* assertion */
  })
})
```

## vuex store
### Modules

Split your vuex code into modules: one per 'resource'. This should roughly match the API's different URLS, eg. `api.schoolsyst.com/homework` should be handled by `store/homework.js`.

### State

Include one empty array with the resource's plural name as the key, one boolean value set to `false` named `loaded`, and additionnal constants that may be reused in the code base (eg. possible values of choice-restricted API fields.)

### Mutations

Construct your mutations using `store/index.js`pass:['s] `getMutations`.

### Actions

For each mutation, when the API request fails, handle the error by showing the user a `$toast.error`.

Each mutation should return...

When the action succeededs :: 
  `{ data: object, error: null]` with `object` the value returned by the matching mutation, or the inner action's `object` return value.

When the action fails because of a validation error :: 
  `{ data: validation, error: 'validation'}` with `validation` the value returned by the `validate` getter, or by the inner action's `validation` return value

When the action fails because of a network error ::
  `{ data: error, error: 'network'}` with `error` the error object from the `try`/`catch` block.

More generally, the return value is an object with:

1. the object/array that results from the underlying mutation
2. the failure level, if any. If it succeeded, this is `null`.

Include the following actions: 

load({ force: false, verbose: false }) ::
  - If `loaded` is false or `force` is true
  ** Do a `GET` request
  ** Use the `SET` mutation to store the response in the store
  ** Call the `POSTLOAD` mutation (which sets `loaded` to true.)
  ** If `verbose` is true
  *** Show a `$toast.success` with an appropriate message

post({ data, force: false, verbose: true }) :: 
  * If `force` is false
  ** Validate `data` with the `validate` getter
  ** Let _validated_ be the boolean result of that validation
  * If _validated_ is true or `force` is true
  ** Do a `POST` request with `data`
  ** get the UUID from the response
  ** Do a `GET` request with that UUID
  ** Call the `ADD` mutation with that response
  ** If `verbose` is true
  *** Show the user a `$toast.success` with an appropriate message
  * Else
  ** Show the user a `$toast` with an appropriate error message
  ** Return false and the validation object


patch({ pk, data, force: false, verbose: true }) ::
  * Let _hydrated_ be the object with `data` applied
  * If `force` is false
  ** Validate _hydrated_ with the `validate` getter
  ** Let _validated_ be the boolean result of that validation
  * If _validated_ is true or `force` is true
  ** Do a `PATCH` request with `data`
  ** get the UUID from the response
  ** Do a `GET` request with that UUID
  ** Call the `CHANGE` mutation with that response
  ** If `verbose` is true
  *** Show the user a `$toast.success` with an appropriate message
  * Else
  ** Show the user a `$toast` with an appropriate error message
  ** Return false and the validation object


remove({ pk, force: false, verbose: true }) ::
  * If `force` is false
  ** Search for a resource with `pk` as its primary key in the store
  ** If no object can be found
  *** Return `[false, null, 'validation']`
  * Let _object_ be the found object
  * Return `[true, _object_, null]`

### Getters

Include the following getters:

one(value, { by: '_your_default_pk_' }) ::
  * Return a single object from the resources object with its `by` property matching `value`.

all() ::
  * Return the resource array from the state

order(objects, { by: '_your_default_sorting_method_' }) ::
  * Return the `objects`, sorted using the `by` sorting method. (each sorting method is specific to the resource)

## Code clarity guidelines
### In vue files' <template>

Language :: html
Indentation :: 2 spaces
write component tag names in :: kebab-case
Class for root element of every component :: .--<component-kebab-case>; eg. for <BaseCard> root element has class=--base-card

#### Attribute list order

Put attributes in the following order:

1. Definition: `is` (or `:is`)
1. List rendering: `v-for`
1. Conditionals `v-if`, `v-else-if`, `v-else`, `v-show`, `v-cloak`
1. Render modifiers: `v-pre`, `v-once`
1. Unique attributes: `ref`, `key` (or `:key`) note: `key` should be on the same line as `v-for`, _even when you use one attribute per line_. This helps differentiate `key` from other props
1. Two-way binding: `v-model`
1. Other directives: 
1. Bound attributes: `:attribute-name`
1. Regular attributes: `attribute-name`
1. Value-less attributes: `attribute-name` (without `="value"`)
1. Events: `@event-name`, `v-touch`
1. Content: `v-html`, `v-text`, `v-tooltip`

#### Directive shorthands

_Always_ use the v- shorthands:

[horizontal]
Use... :: Instead of
`:attr` :: `v-bind:attr` note: a bare `v-bind` is still allowed
`@event` :: `v-on:event`
`#name` :: `v-slot:name`

#### Attribute values

Only the following should be written in attribute values

* a unique scalar value
** for template strings, interpolated values should be variables only.
* an object literal with â‰¤ 5 words:
** a key counts as a word
** a value counts as a word
*** the value should be a scalar or a variable
* a unique function call
* a unique variable

For object literals, don't add spaces around the braces (but do it in JS code)

For multi-values attributes (eg. `style` or `class`), prefer an object literal of computed values instead of a single computed value returning the entire object:

.`<template>`
```html
<component
  :style="{backgroundColor, color: subjectNameColor}"
>
```

.`<script>`
```js
computed: {
  backgroundColor() {
    return this.color || 'var(--black)'
  },
  subjectNameColor() {
    return this.color ? this.textColor()(this.color) : 'var(--white)'
  },
}
```

Instead of:

.`<template>`
```html
<component :style="styles">
```

.`<script>`
```js
computed: {
  styles() {
    return {
      backgroundColor: this.color || 'var(--black)',
      color: this.color ? this.textColor()(this.color) : 'var(--white)'
    }
  }
}
```

##### An exception for conditional directives (`v-if`, `v-else-if`)

In conditonnal directives, the value can be one of the above, or a logical-operator-separated list of variables, but there must be at most two operators.

.Example
```html
<template v-if="loggedIn || passwordForgotten">
```

If the exact same condition is reused, make a computed property instead.

#### Line breaks in attribute lists

If the element contains more than two attributes:

.Bad example
```html
<template v-if="thing" my-stuff :thingie="foo" bar="baz" quux>
```

.Good example
```html
<template
  v-if="thing"
  :thingie="foo"
  bar="baz"
  my-stuff
  quux
>
```

### In vue _component_ file's <script>

If your component declares props that have different purposes, separate them with a comment into three categories:

- Data
- Supporting data (non-essential, must declare a default)
- Styling

.Example
```javascript
props: {
  // Data
  color: {
    type: String,
    default: null
  },
  name: {
    type: String,
    default: null
  },
  // Supporting data
  placeholderName: {
    type: String,
    default: 'Choisir...'
  },
  // Style
  clickable: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false
  },
  variant: {
    type: String,
    default: 'badge'
  },
  thin: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false
  },
  noTooltip: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false
  }
},
```

### In vue _component_ files' <style>
  
Language :: stylus
Indentation :: 2 spaces

### Sections
Separate your styles into sections using the following comment decorations (including the surrounding blank lines):

```

//
// SECTION_NAME
//

```

Include the following sections, in order:

. Definitions +
  _Includes stylus variables & functions as well as CSS variables_
. Layout +
  _Includes `position`, `display`, all positioning, sizing & spacing-related properties_
. Decoration +
  _Includes all `border-` properties, `outline` & `box-shadow`.
. Colors +
  _Includes `color`, `background-color`, `opacity`._
. Typography +
  _Includes all `font-` properties and `text-decoration`._
. Reactions +
  _Includes selectors that use `:hover`, `:focus` or other interaction-related pseudo selectors or classes, as well as `transition`, `animation` and `@keyframes`._
. Hacks +
  _CSS Hacks / bad practice styling rules. Don't include the section comment if this section is empty_
  
### Selector nesting

.Nest selectors when...
* The class name is not unique to the component
* Constructing multiple selectors with `&` becomes more readable than listing all selectors explicitly (should *not* exceed 3 indentation levels)

### Selector separations

- Put 2 empty lines between selectors that apply to a different part of the component
- Put 1 empty lines between selectors that apply to the same part of the component

### Value references

Sometimes, we're forced to use constant values when refering to something else (eg. the padding on this component should be equal to the navbar's height).

These kind of rules, if left undocumented, are huge sources of confusion when values referenced change.

To work around this, add a comment above or after the rule:

.Reference notice comment specification
```
//ref: <COMPONENT_NAME> [SELECTOR] REFERENCED_PROPERTY [(EXPLANATION)]
```

With:

COMPONENT_NAME :: The referenced component
SELECTOR :: The selector (if omitted, the selector is the component's root element)
REFERENCED_PROPERTY :: The property the rule gets its value from
EXPLANATION :: Explain why you must do a reference.

## Commit messages

This repository follows the https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji[gitmoji] commit standard.
Additonal conventions are added on top of the intent-indicating emoji. Here's how commit titles should be constructed:

```
EMOJI [SCOPE_PREFIX SCOPE SCOPE_SUFFIX] IMPERATIVE_SENTENCE
```

With:

EMOJI :: The emoji used. Must follow the gitmoji standard. A second emoji can be appended to the first if it is one of the following:
- ðŸ’© (Writing bad code that needs to be fixed)
- ðŸš§ (Work in progress)
SCOPE_PREFIX, SCOPE_SUFFIX :: Indicates if the changes apply to one particular area of the codebase. Must be one of the <<Scope Prefix/Suffix characters>>
SCOPE :: Indicates the file/topic affected.
IMPERATIVE_SENTENCE :: A sentence at the imperative tense, indicating the change applied to the codebase.


### Scope Prefix/Suffix characters
The scope prefix indicates what area of the codebase changed.
Less specific than the scope itself, but useful because file names overlaps. (eg. homework is a page & vuex module)

.Prefixes
[horizontal]
pass:[=] :: Store (vuex)
< :: Components
/ :: Pages
$ :: Plugins
% :: Layouts
~ :: Middlewares
pass:[#] :: Assets
&nbsp; :: Other (no scope prefix)

.Suffixes
[horizontal]
pass:[>] :: Components
: :: Everything else
